## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

### Some considerations

 - Supported by android devices with minimum Android OS 4.1 version, targetting Android 10 devices. Also supported for iOS devices using iOS 12 or high.
 
 - For iOS Launch Screen is recommended by Apple to follow these guidelines: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/launch-screen/
   Therefore an animation should not be necessary. In the iOS template provided you have a blank launch screen. After that it runs the application showing the Lottie Animation. Finally it runs our Flutter code showing the Login page.
